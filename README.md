# Gophor

A Gopher server written in GoLang as a means of learning about the Gopher
protocol, and more GoLang.

Possibly beta quality soon? More likely alpha right now.

`go build` and you're set to go! (...phor ha)

Linux only FOR NOW.

# Features

- ZERO external dependencies

- Item type characters beyond RFC 1436 standard (see below)

- Security focused -- `Until we reach beta/stable, maybe don't trust this...`

- File caching -- Until LRU is implemented, this means cache size is infinite,
  which for a gopher server of very limited size, this is fine. Probably.

- Separate system and access logging with output to file if requested (or
  disable both!)

```
